Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <project_directory>
Install the project dependencies:

Copy code

Start the development server:

The project will open in your default browser at http://localhost:3000/. You can now make changes to the code and see the changes in the browser.

Once you're ready to deploy the project, you can build the production-ready version:

The built version will be placed in the build/ directory, which you can then deploy to a hosting service.
