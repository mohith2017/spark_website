# How to Run the Project
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

<br>
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:


```git clone <repository_url>```

<br>
Navigate to the project directory:

```cd <project_directory>```

<br>
Install the project dependencies:

```npm install```

<br>
Start the development server:

```npm start```

The project will open in your default browser at http://localhost:3000/. You can now make changes to the code and see the changes in the browser.

Once you're ready to deploy the project, you can build the production-ready version:


```npm run build```
<br><br>
The built version will be placed in the build/ directory, which you can then deploy to a hosting service.
